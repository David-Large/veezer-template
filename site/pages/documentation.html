  The Veezer template uses liquid templating within the <a
  href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eleventy SSG
  (Static Site Generator).</a> It's configured to be edited in the <a
  href="https://cloudcannon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CloudCannon</a>
  environment.


  I didn't initially start out it with the intention of sharing Veezer. However,
  preparing this for public view has forced me to spend a lot of time to iterate
  and refine things. I'm hoping I can at least provide some ideas for others and
  maybe get some feedback on how to improve it.


  ## Basic needs and wants I started out with:


  #### Keep editing simple.


  Simplify and automate as much of the editing process so that editors can work
  purely with content. Avoid those editors needing to consider specific layout
  options (apart from those built into the CloudCannon Bookshop components).


  #### Provide a way to keep a consistent theme.


  Keep consistency between pages using a configurarable theme. The theme is
  based on a series of light and dark background and text colours that once set
  up, can be selected via a dropdown within the added component.


  #### Use a partial page refresh.


  Using the Fetch API, load just the content for the new page into the `<main>`
  tag of the primary template (the main navigation bar and footer remain
  unaffected). This replaces the previous page content.


  #### Use GSAP animation.


  Make use of animations like fade-ins and position transitions for a smoother
  experience. Ensure animations are triggered only when images have been fully
  loaded by the browser.


  #### Keep to 'vanilla' javascript.<br>Cut out the frameworks.


  There are no javascript frameworks used. Also, for things like image
  sliders/carousels, I've used my own plain javascript.


  Using my own javascript (and CSS with the help of <a href="https://bulma.io/"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bulma CSS</a>) I can easily reconfigure my
  sliders, carousels and the like since they follow the same pattern. I'm not
  needing to wade through a full 'bells and whistles' library that does more
  than I need but is really hard to just add that 4rem padding :)


  #### ...but don't reinvent the wheel.


  Having said about reducing third-party javascript, the template uses a great
  little image lightbox - <a href="https://fslightbox.com/" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">Fullscreen Lightbox</a>. Also the <a href="https://gsap.com/"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">GSAP Animation Library</a> works really well.


  #### Keep the page loading speed respectable.


  Without making it the primary goal, try to keep the page load times in check.
