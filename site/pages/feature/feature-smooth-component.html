        description: >-
          The trees of Frostwood were bound by ancient promises, their bark
          etched with runes older than iron. Snow gathered softly on their
          branches, never breaking them, as if the forest itself honored the
          oaths sworn beneath its canopy. Those who walked here felt watched not
          by gods, but by the memory of vows still unbroken.

      - title: The hearth of pine and ash...
        description: >-
          Each cabin hearth was lit from embers carried across generations,
          wrapped in cloth and prayer. Pine logs crackled with resinous scent,
          and ash was never discarded—only returned to the soil with care.
          Warmth, the elders said, was not made by fire alone, but by respect
          for what once burned.

      - title: Where ravens mark the way...
        description: >-
          Ravens gathered along the forest paths at dawn, black shapes against
          pale sky. They did not caw or scatter, but waited, hopping forward
          when travelers chose rightly and lifting away when they strayed. To
          follow ravens was to walk with fate close at hand.

      - title: The silent snowfall...
        description: >-
          When the first heavy snow came, all sound faded but the heart’s own
          rhythm. Cabins vanished into white, smoke rising like prayer threads
          into the sky. In that stillness, the forest listened—and some claimed
          it answered, speaking through creaking timber and settling ice.

      - title: Roots beneath the long night...
        description: >-
          Beneath frozen ground, roots remained awake. They carried warmth from
          deep places, sharing it with cabins built in trust. During the long
          night, when sun and hope felt distant, it was the roots that held the
          land together, whispering that dawn would return.

      - title: Runes at the threshold...
        description: >-
          No door was left unmarked. Simple runes were carved into lintels—not
          for protection, but for remembrance. They named the builders, the
          season of raising, and the forest that allowed it. To cross such a
          threshold was to step into a story still being written.
