      Paragraph:


      Fantasy typography combines imaginative design with clear readability,
      drawing inspiration from illuminated manuscripts, runes, and hand-crafted
      lettering. Decorative serifs, flowing strokes, and subtle ornamentation
      help evoke age, magic, and myth without overwhelming the text. When used
      thoughtfully, it establishes atmosphere instantly, suggesting history and
      wonder before the story even begins.


      'Lead' paragraph:


      <p class="lead">Fantasy typography focuses on mood as much as form, using
      stylised letter shapes to echo themes of magic, legend, and forgotten
      worlds. Inspired by calligraphy, carved stone, and ancient scripts, it
      often feels crafted rather than mechanical. Strong fantasy type subtly
      supports the setting, helping the reader feel the weight of history and
      imagination behind the words.</p>

      > Writing a spell cookbook combines creativity with clarity, presenting
      each spell like a recipe with ingredients, steps, and tips for timing or
      intent. Clear instructions ensure consistent results, while optional
      variations invite experimentation. The best spell cookbooks balance
      practicality with wonder, guiding readers to explore magic in a hands-on,
      enchanting way.
