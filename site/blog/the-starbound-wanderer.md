Across the velvet expanse of the cosmos, where constellations shifted like living maps, the Starbound Wanderers roamed. Wizards of rare skill and restless hearts, they rode on starlight itself, weaving spells into the fabric of space to bend gravity, shape nebulae, and leave trails of shimmering runes that could be read only by those who truly understood the old arts. Each journey carried danger—the void was vast, and otherworldly entities stirred in the shadows between stars—but the thrill of discovery drew them ever onward.

To navigate the infinite night, a Wanderer had to master spells that transcended planets:

* Light could be folded like paper, creating bridges across the distance of galaxies.
* Time itself was malleable, allowing the careful wizard to witness past events written in the movement of stars.
* Cosmic currents carried memories, emotions, and whispers of ancient beings, which could be tapped to enhance spells—or overwhelm the unprepared.

Lyra, one of the youngest Wanderers, paused at the edge of a sparkling nebula, sensing a pulse unlike any she had felt before. The stars around her thrummed with resonance, echoing her own heartbeat, and in that instant, she understood that the universe was not merely a canvas for magic—it was alive, listening, and responding. Each spell cast among the stars left a mark not just on the cosmos, but on the wizard who dared to wander through it.
