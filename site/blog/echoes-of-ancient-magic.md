  In the forgotten corners of the world, where forests grew taller than
  mountains and rivers ran silver under moonlight, the remnants of magic

In the forgotten corners of the world, where forests grew taller than mountains and rivers ran silver under moonlight, the remnants of magic lingered like perfume. It was not the flashy, wild magic of battle, but the subtle, breathing kind—threads of power woven into stone, wind, and water. Those who could feel it knew it whispered in ways the untrained mind could scarcely grasp: a hum in the roots, a shimmer in the air, a pulse beneath the fingertips.

### The Language of Power

The ancient magic spoke in patterns and resonance, revealing its secrets only to those willing to listen:

* Spells were not cast, but remembered, unlocking themselves in hearts and hands attuned to the old rhythm.
* Objects could carry memories of enchantments long faded, and a touch could awaken centuries of dormant energy.
* Even the smallest gesture—a sigh, a glance, a whispered word—could ripple through the weave and alter reality in ways both subtle and profound.

When Selara stepped into the heart of the old ruins, the echoes responded, coiling around her like a living tapestry. Light bent unnaturally, water rose to trace the shapes of forgotten runes, and the wind carried voices of mages long gone, offering guidance and challenge alike. Magic was not a tool here; it was a presence, ancient and eternal, and for those who could hear its call, the world itself became a song—an intricate, shimmering echo of power that waited to be understood.
