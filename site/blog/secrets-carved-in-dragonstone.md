**✨ Secrets Carved in Dragonstone – An Immersive Feast ✨**<br>*Step into the fire-forged halls of Dragonstone, where every bite reveals a secret and every sip sparks wonder.*

---

#### Appetizers – Whispers of the Ember

* **Ember-Spiced Dragon Wings** – Served on a plate of glowing embers (illusionary, of course), these wings hiss with heat when touched, releasing a smoky aroma that awakens courage.
* **Stoneheart Mushrooms** – Baked in hollowed dragonstone bowls, the mushrooms pulse faintly with a soft light, revealing ancient runes as steam curls upward.
* **Crystalized Firefruit Salad** – The shimmering fruits tinkle like tiny bells when stirred, telling tales of forests touched by dragonfire.

#### Main Courses – The Dragon’s Trial

* **Dragonbone Roast** – The carved roast is presented with a flourish, and a wisp of enchanted flame dances along the platter, warming the meat and the diners’ hearts.
* **Molten Cavern Stew** – Ladled from a cauldron that seems to glow from within, each spoonful releases a tiny puff of smoky mist, hinting at underground caverns where dragons once slumbered.
* **Skyfire Seared Fish** – Fillets arrive glowing faintly, kissed by starlight flames that vanish when eaten, leaving a lingering taste of the cosmos.

#### Sides & Accompaniments – Treasures Unearthed

* **Obsidian Potato Skewers** – The blackened potatoes shimmer faintly, like polished stones, and crunch with a satisfying “rocky” snap.
* **Runestone Greens** – Tossed in a vinaigrette that sparkles faintly, each leaf hums softly when lifted, resonating with the ancient magic of Dragonstone.
* **Dragon’s Breath Cornbread** – Bite-sized pieces emit tiny spirals of warm smoke when broken, a playful reminder of the dragons’ presence.

#### Desserts – Secrets in Sweetness

* **Amber Flame Pudding** – A small flame flickers atop each custard, edible and magical, vanishing as the first spoonful is taken.
* **Dragon’s Eye Truffles** – The center of each truffle glows faintly, like a tiny gem, revealing visions of long-lost dragon treasures.
* **Smokewood Sorbet** – Served in crystalline bowls, the sorbet releases fragrant tendrils of smokewood essence, carrying whispers of forgotten spells.

#### Beverages – Elixirs of Power

* **Molten Ale** – Warm, golden, and faintly sparkling, each sip seems to awaken a hidden ember within the drinker.
* **Starfall Elixir** – Tiny “falling stars” float in the drink, leaving trails of glimmering sweetness as they dissolve.
* **Dragon’s Breath Tea** – Poured from a steaming cauldron, the tea’s smoke forms ephemeral dragon shapes that curl above the cup before vanishing.
