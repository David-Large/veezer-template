The Forgotten Realm announced itself not with spectacle, but with absence. Sound softened there, as if the world were holding its breath, and colours bled gently into one another like memories recalled too late. Those who wandered too close felt an ache they could not name—a sense that something essential had slipped through their fingers long ago. The realm fed on neglect, growing richer with every story untold and every promise quietly abandoned.

Eryndor crossed into it at twilight, guided by the low murmur that threaded through his thoughts. The ground beneath his boots was warm, pulsing faintly like a living heart, and distant silhouettes drifted through the mist—former kings, nameless heroes, ordinary souls paused mid-regret. As he ventured deeper, the whispers began to separate, each one offering a fragment of truth about the realm and its purpose:

* The Forgotten Realm was not a prison, but a sanctuary for what the living world could no longer carry.
* Its shadows were shaped by memory, changing form as visitors recalled or rejected their past.
* Nothing could be taken from the realm without leaving something behind in exchange.
* Those who listened carefully could hear their own name spoken last, before it vanished forever.

At the center stood a vast hollow tree, its bark etched with countless symbols that shifted as Eryndor watched. When he placed his hand upon it, the whispers fell silent, replaced by understanding. The realm did not seek to be remembered—it sought balance. Carrying that knowledge back with him, Eryndor felt the weight of the Forgotten Realm settle lightly into his soul, a reminder that what is lost is never truly gone, so long as someone is willing to listen.
