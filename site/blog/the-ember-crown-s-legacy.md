The Ember Crown was forged in an age when fire still listened to kings, its living embers bound into a circlet that burned without consuming. When its last bearer fell, the crown vanished, leaving behind a kingdom that slowly forgot how to hope. Yet embers remember what ashes cannot, and deep beneath the quiet ruins, the crown’s warmth still stirred, waiting for a will strong enough to wake it.

### A Flame That Endures

When the crown is found again, it does not demand blood or conquest, but stewardship. Its fire passes not to the strongest hand, but to the one willing to carry its burden—rekindling courage, mending old fractures, and proving that true legacy is not the power to rule, but the resolve to keep the flame alive for those who come after.
