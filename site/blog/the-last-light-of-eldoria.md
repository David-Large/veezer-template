Eldoria had once been a land of radiant spires and endless skies, but now only one light remained: a single lantern hanging from the tallest tower, its flame stubborn against the encroaching shadows. Legends said it was the last gift of the sun itself, preserved to guide those who still believed in hope. Few dared climb the jagged cliffs to see it, for the path was steep, and the darkness below whispered doubts that could turn the bravest heart to stone.

Kaelen had heard the stories all his life, but standing at the base of the tower, he understood that the light was more than legend—it was a living pulse, fragile yet unyielding. Every step upward made the wind sharper, every gust a test of resolve. The shadows below twisted, forming faces he recognized from memory and fear, trying to pull him back. Yet the lantern’s glow never wavered, as if urging him onward with the promise of a dawn that might never come.

When Kaelen finally reached the top, the last light of Eldoria bathed him in warmth and clarity. In that glow, he saw not only the ruins of a kingdom but the resilience of its people, reflected in the courage it had taken to survive. He realized then that the light’s true power was not to banish darkness entirely, but to remind the world that even when everything else falls away, hope endures—and those willing to carry it can rekindle the dawn.
