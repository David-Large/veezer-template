This template uses the great site Unsplash.com to provide the imagery. They are real images made by real people.

All images displayed will be as an `<img>` element (rather than a backgound image) so should be easy enough to right click and view. However, they will not be the original size as downloaded from Unsplash.

The image file names have been kept as-is from Unsplash so to find the artist of images you like and want to find out more about, check out the file name then search them up. e.g. ***josh-hild**\-6kvgxihrita-unsplash.jpg*
