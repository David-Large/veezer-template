This serene, world-wide observance occurs when a rare celestial alignment fills the sky with shimmering silver stars. For one night, warfare is forbidden, and even enemies are expected to lay down arms. The event celebrates hope, renewal, and the shared sky beneath which all beings live.

Communities gather for quiet reflection, star-reading, and storytelling. Many believe wishes made under the silver stars carry unusual power, and countless legends trace life-changing moments back to this sacred night.
