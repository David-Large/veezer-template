Held during times of great crisis, the Last Light Convocation gathers the wisest and most powerful figures remaining in the world. Its purpose is singular: to prevent total collapse. The “Last Light” symbolizes hope when all other options are exhausted.

Discussions are grave and sacrifices expected. Ancient relics may be unleashed, forbidden powers considered, and irreversible choices made. Legends say that if the Convocation fails, the world enters an age of darkness from which it may never recover.
