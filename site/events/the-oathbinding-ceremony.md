The Oathbinding Ceremony is where alliances, vows, and lifelong promises are sealed by ancient magic. Spoken oaths manifest as glowing sigils, binding the speaker’s fate to their word. Breaking such an oath carries severe consequences, both mystical and personal.

This event is often used for treaties, knighthoods, and sacred unions. Witnesses understand they are not merely observing words, but the shaping of destiny itself.
