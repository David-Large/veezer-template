This rare celebration honors the coexistence of opposing forces: shadow and light, secrecy and truth. It is believed that imbalance between these forces leads to catastrophe. The Jubilee features dual ceremonies—one held at dusk, the other at midnight beneath the stars.

Artists, illusionists, and philosophers play a central role, using performance to explore moral complexity. The event encourages unity through contrast, reminding all that neither shadow nor starlight can exist alone.
