This grand diplomatic summit brings together emissaries from five distinct realms—each with its own culture, magic, and political ambitions. The event showcases ceremonial processions, formal debates, and ancient customs meant to honor old alliances while negotiating new ones. Tension often simmers beneath the pageantry as rival histories and unresolved conflicts resurface.

Beyond politics, the Gathering is also a cultural exchange. Artifacts, music, magical traditions, and culinary delicacies from each realm are displayed, allowing visitors to glimpse the diversity of the world. It is widely believed that decisions made here shape the fate of the realms for generations.
