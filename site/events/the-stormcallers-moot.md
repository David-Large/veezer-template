The Stormcallers’ Moot is a raw, elemental gathering of weather-shapers, sky shamans, and sea-priests. Held atop cliffs or floating isles, it coincides with violent tempests summoned intentionally to empower the rites. Control, not chaos, is the ultimate test here.

The Moot showcases mastery over wind, rain, and lightning, but also debates responsibility. Stormcallers decide how their powers should be used—whether to protect lands, punish enemies, or preserve balance. Their choices often affect entire coastlines and civilizations.
