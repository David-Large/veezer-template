This mysterious masquerade exists at the boundary between the mortal world and the spirit realm. Attendees wear enchanted masks that conceal identity and may even alter form, allowing spirits, fae, and mortals to mingle without fear or prejudice. Deals struck here are magically binding.

Behind the elegance lies danger. Truths are revealed, secrets traded, and hidden desires exposed. Many leave changed—blessed, cursed, or awakened to realities they cannot forget.
