This festival commemorates the fall of tyrants and the end of oppressive reigns throughout history. Rather than mourning lost monarchies, it celebrates liberation, resilience, and the power of the people. Mock crowns are broken in public ceremonies, symbolizing the impermanence of absolute power.

The event features storytelling, theater, and reenactments of famous revolutions. Beneath the revelry lies a subtle warning: no ruler is beyond consequence. In some regions, current leaders attend as a reminder that their authority exists only by trust, not divine right.
