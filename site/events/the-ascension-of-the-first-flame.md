This sacred ceremony reenacts the mythic moment when fire was first gifted to the world. A chosen champion or priestess is tasked with carrying the First Flame—an eternal spark said to judge the bearer’s worth. If accepted, the bearer gains immense authority or power.

The event blends myth, faith, and political legitimacy. Crowds gather in reverent silence, knowing the outcome may change leadership, ignite holy wars, or restore balance between light and darkness.
