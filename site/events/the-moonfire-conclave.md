Held under a full moon once every decade, the Moonfire Conclave is a secretive assembly of mages, seers, and scholars of celestial magic. The event centers on shared rituals performed to renew ancient wards, realign ley lines, and interpret cosmic omens revealed by moonfire—a rare silvery flame that appears only during the conclave.

In addition to ritual magic, the Conclave serves as a forum for exchanging forbidden knowledge. New spells are debated, old prophecies reexamined, and apprentices formally initiated. Attendance is by invitation only, and what transpires within the circle is never spoken of openly.
