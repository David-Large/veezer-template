The Dawnforge Assembly marks the symbolic beginning of a new age or era. Held at first light, it brings together leaders, innovators, and visionaries to unveil new inventions, magical advancements, and bold societal reforms. The rising sun represents rebirth and forward momentum.

Ceremonies include the lighting of the Dawnforge—an ancient anvil said to spark inspiration. Decrees announced here often guide the direction of kingdoms, making the Assembly a beacon of progress, optimism, and sometimes controversy.
