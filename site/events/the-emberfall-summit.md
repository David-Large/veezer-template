The Emberfall Summit takes place at a volcanic stronghold where fire-based clans and forge-masters convene. Its primary purpose is to negotiate resource sharing, forge legendary weapons, and renew ancient fire-oaths sworn in molten stone. Rivers of lava illuminate the event, giving it an awe-inspiring yet dangerous atmosphere.

Alongside diplomacy, the Summit showcases feats of endurance and craftsmanship. Smiths compete to create masterpieces, while warriors prove their worth in ritual trials of heat and flame. To survive Emberfall is considered a mark of honor.
