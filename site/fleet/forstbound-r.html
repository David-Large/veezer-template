      Built for endurance in the harshest climates, the Forstbound R thrives
      where ice, snow, and frozen stone dominate. Its reinforced chassis is
      wrapped in frost-tempered plating that resists cracking under extreme
      cold, while the suspension dynamically adapts to shifting terrain beneath
      packed snow or glacial ice.


      The Forstbound R’s **Cryolock Traction System** creates micro-freeze
      anchors with each wheel rotation, ensuring unparalleled grip on slick
      surfaces. Within the cabin, runic heat channels provide steady warmth
      without draining power reserves, making long journeys through frozen
      wastelands not just possible, but comfortable.


      **Power Core Output** – 700 Arc-Watts


      **Mana Efficiency** – 17 km/unit


      **Aether Drive Type** – Cryo Pulse Drive


      **Top Speed** – 290 km/h


      **Shield Rating** – 7


      **Special Ability** – Freezes road behind vehicle
