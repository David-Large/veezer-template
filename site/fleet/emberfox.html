  The Emberfox is engineered for speed with a cunning edge, blending agile
  framework with a magically infused combustion core. Its body panels are forged
  from embersteel alloys that glow faintly under strain, dispersing heat while
  enhancing acceleration bursts.

      The Emberfox is engineered for speed with a cunning edge, blending agile
      framework with a magically infused combustion core. Its body panels are
      forged from embersteel alloys that glow faintly under strain, dispersing
      heat while enhancing acceleration bursts. Designed for sharp turns and
      sudden sprints, the Emberfox excels in environments where reflexes matter
      more than brute force.


      Its signature feature, the **Cinder Pulse Drive**, allows the vehicle to
      release controlled thermal surges for short-distance boosts without
      destabilizing handling. Inside, the cockpit responds to driver intent
      through heat-sensitive runes, making the Emberfox feel less like a machine
      and more like a living extension of its pilot.


      **Power Core Output** – 820 Arc-Watts


      **Mana Efficiency** – 14 km/unit


      **Aether Drive Type** – Dual Flame Aether


      **Top Speed** – 310 km/h


      **Shield Rating** – 6


      **Special Ability** – Boost ignites trail of burning air
