  The Void Howler is raw power shaped by darkness, engineered for those who
  thrive at the edge of control. Its frame is reinforced with nullstone
  composites that dampen external forces while amplifying internal output,
  creating a vehicle that feels both heavy and unstoppable.

      The Void Howler is raw power shaped by darkness, engineered for those who
      thrive at the edge of control. Its frame is reinforced with nullstone
      composites that dampen external forces while amplifying internal output,
      creating a vehicle that feels both heavy and unstoppable.


      Its defining feature, the **Abyssal Resonance Engine**, channels void
      energy into a low-frequency roar that disrupts nearby systems and terrain.
      When the Void Howler moves, the world seems to recoil—an intimidating
      force built not just to travel, but to command fear itself.


      **Power Core Output** – 900 Arc-Watts


      **Mana Efficiency** – 12 km/unit


      **Aether Drive Type** – Void Slip Drive


      **Top Speed** – 325 km/h


      **Shield Rating** – 7


      **Special Ability** – Short-range teleport dodge
