  The Iron Sylph merges heavy armor with an uncanny lightness, defying
  expectations at every turn. Despite its formidable metallic shell, arcane
  levitation filaments reduce weight and enhance maneuverability, allowing the
  Sylph to glide across roads with near-effortless grace.

      The Iron Sylph merges heavy armor with an uncanny lightness, defying
      expectations at every turn. Despite its formidable metallic shell, arcane
      levitation filaments reduce weight and enhance maneuverability, allowing
      the Sylph to glide across roads with near-effortless grace.


      Its defining feature, the **Aether Balance Core**, continuously
      recalibrates gravity vectors around the vehicle, granting exceptional
      stability at high speeds. Drivers praise the Iron Sylph for its smooth
      handling and whisper-quiet movement—an armored sentinel that moves like
      wind given form.


      **Power Core Output** – 710 Arc-Watts


      **Mana Efficiency** – 16 km/unit


      **Aether Drive Type** – Windbound Axles


      **Top Speed** – 300 km/h


      **Shield Rating** – 6


      **Special Ability** – Automatically stabilizes in crosswinds
