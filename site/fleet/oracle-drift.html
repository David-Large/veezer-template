  Designed for those who trust foresight as much as skill, the Oracle Drift

  that subtly adjust steering, torque, and braking in anticipation of obstacles
  before they fully manifest.

      Designed for those who trust foresight as much as skill, the Oracle Drift
      redefines precision driving. Its frame is interwoven with divination
      sigils that subtly adjust steering, torque, and braking in anticipation of
      obstacles before they fully manifest.


      The **Prescience Flow Engine** offers momentary glimpses of probable
      paths, allowing the vehicle to drift through complex courses with
      near-supernatural accuracy. Inside, the cockpit glows with soft predictive
      glyphs, giving drivers the sensation of moving one step ahead of reality
      itself.


      **Power Core Output** – 660 Arc-Watts


      **Mana Efficiency** – 20 km/unit


      **Aether Drive Type** – Predictive Flux Drive


      **Top Speed** – 280 km/h


      **Shield Rating** – 5


      **Special Ability** – Anticipates turns before driver
