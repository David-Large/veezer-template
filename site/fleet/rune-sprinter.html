  The Rune Sprinter is a master of long-distance speed, optimized for sustained
  velocity rather than short bursts. Its aerodynamic shell is etched with
  kinetic runes that store momentum, releasing it gradually to maintain top
  speeds without excessive energy drain.

      The Rune Sprinter is a master of long-distance speed, optimized for
      sustained velocity rather than short bursts. Its aerodynamic shell is
      etched with kinetic runes that store momentum, releasing it gradually to
      maintain top speeds without excessive energy drain.


      Its hallmark feature, the **Glyphbound Relay Drive**, allows seamless
      transitions between terrain types without loss of pace. Favored by
      messengers and racers alike, the Rune Sprinter turns endurance into an art
      form, delivering speed that never seems to tire.


      **Power Core Output** – 640 Arc-Watts


      **Mana Efficiency** – 22 km/unit


      **Aether Drive Type** – Glyphbound Wheels


      **Top Speed** – 270 km/h


      **Shield Rating** – 5


      **Special Ability** – Speed increases near magic sources
